?openvpn-build (external buildsystem)
"generic": cross-compile on *NIX platforms (e.g. Linux -> Windows)
"msvc": build using MSVC on Windows
"windows-nsis": generate Windows installers on *NIX
These changes have resulted in a number of user-visible changes:

OpenVPN 2.3-alpha1

This release includes a large number of new features:

Complete IPv6 support, both transport and payload
Optional PolarSSL support (build time configuration)
Improved plug-in API (v3) which can more easily be expanded in the future. Includes support for direct access to X.509 certificate data in plug-ins
New build-time configuration option: --enable-lzo-stub - Clients tell the server if they support LZO or not, and server can automatically disable LZO for that client.
?New OpenVPN-GUI
New options / updated options
--stale-routes-check: remove routes that haven't had activity recently
--client-nat: one-to-one NAT to avoid IP address conflicts between local and remote networks
--extra-certs: certificates which completes the CA chain, without trusting these certificates
--verify-hash: Fingerprint matching on level-1 certificates
--memstats: Write live usage stats to memory mapped binary files
--crl-verify directory mode: file names in this dir which matching the serial numbers are treated as a revoked certificate. These files itself may be empty, as it is only done a match against the file name.
Management interface improvements
New option --management-external-key: Load RSA keys via management interface
New option --management-up-down: notify management interface on tunnel up/down events
New management command for servers: client-kill
New management command for clients: auth-token provides a feature to avoid storing passwords in memory and use a temporary token as an alternative to passing the password.
New management command for clients: remote which can override the configured --remote options
Many enhancements are also included:

Management command for server, status, can report username for each connected user (requires status log version >= 2)
UTF-8 support for certificate fields
Windows UTF-8 support: Filenames may now contain wide characters and environment variables handled as UCS-2 characters
Fixed client issues with DHCP Router option extraction/deletion with layer 2 DHCP proxies.
Added "on-link" routes on Linux. This solves --redirect-gateway issues where routes are set up with devices instead of IP addresses
Several configuration options are now supported inside <connection> blocks
Add extv3 X509 field support to --x509-username-field
Several man page updates
A few changes have been made which may affect existing installations:

'echo' options will no longer be written to log files and will only be available via the management interface.
The certificate strings have changed syntax to the new standard provided newer OpenSSL APIs. Earlier the format was:
/CN=Common Name/O=Organisation/L=Location

The new format will look like:

CN=Common Name, O=Organisation, L=Location

This change impacts plug-ins, scripts and --tls-remote which parses these certificate strings.
